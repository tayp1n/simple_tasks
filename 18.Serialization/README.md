# simple_tasks

Create a base class "Transport". Inherit “Auto” from it,
"Airplane", "Train". From the class “Auto” inherit the classes “Car
auto”, “Truck”. Inherit classes from the “Airplane” class
Cargo Aircraft and Passenger Aircraft. Create fields for
base class, and add fields to child classes that
will specifically characterize objects of child classes.
Define constructors, methods to populate class fields
(or use properties). Write a method that outputs
information about this type of transport and its characteristics.
Use virtual methods.
